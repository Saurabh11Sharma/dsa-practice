/**
 * Problem 1: Two Sum
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Category: Arrays / Hashing
 *
 * 📝 Problem Statement:
 * Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 * You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 * ⏱ Constraints:
 * - 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * - -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
 * - Only one valid answer exists.
 *
 * ✅ Example:
 * Input:
 *   nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
 *   target = 9
 * Output:
 *   [0, 1]
 * Explanation:
 *   nums[0] + nums[1] == 2 + 7 == 9, so return [0, 1]
